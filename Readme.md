--Assignment details --
Create an Android application that has only one activity. One Editbox, one TextView and 2 Buttons.

The functionality (actions for each button) of the application:

Takes the text from the Editbox and writes it to the TextView after replacing some of its characters based on your Neptun ID according to the next example. My id is igd7ga, so the replacement should be i->g, I->G, d->7, D->7, g->a, G->A so for the my name 'Adam Nagy' the result is 'A7am Naay'.
Take the text from the Editbox and sum the ascii values of its characters and write it to the textView.
Place these functions in a separated JAVA class and write unit local tests for them (at least 5-6 case for each).
